## README.md ### Frameworks and Language Used- Framework: Spring Boot- Language: Java- Persistence: JPA (Java Persistence API)- Database: MySQL### Data Flow#### Controller* AddressController   - POST `/address`: Adds a new address.   - GET `/address`: Retrieves a list of all addresses.   - GET `/address/id/{id}`: Retrieves an address by its ID.   - PUT `/address/id/{id}`: Updates an address by its ID.   - DELETE `/address/id/{id}`: Deletes an address by its ID.* EmpController   - POST `/emp`: Adds a new employee.   - GET `/emp`: Retrieves a list of all employees.   - GET `/emp/id/{id}`: Retrieves an employee by their ID.   - PUT `/emp/id/{id}`: Updates an employee's last name by their ID.   - DELETE `/emp/id/{id}`: Deletes an employee by their ID.#### Services*  ServiceAddress   - `addAddress(Address newAddress)`: Adds an address to the database.   - `getaddress()`: Retrieves a list of all addresses.   - `getaddressbyid(Long id)`: Retrieves an address by its ID.   - `updateaddressbyid(Long id, String city)`: Updates an address's city by its ID.   - `removeaddress(Long id)`: Deletes an address by its ID.* ServiceEmp   - `addemp(Emp emp)`: Adds an employee to the database.   - `getemp()`: Retrieves a list of all employees.   - `getempbyid(Long id)`: Retrieves an employee by their ID.   - `updateempbyid(Long id, String lastname)`: Updates an employee's last name by their ID.   - `removeemp(Long id)`: Deletes an employee by their ID.#### Repository- `AddressRepo`: JpaRepository for the `Address` entity, handling database operations for addresses.- `EmpRepo`: JpaRepository for the `Emp` entity, handling database operations for employees.### Database Design- Two entities: `Address` and `Emp`, representing addresses and employees, respectively.- Both entities are related through a one-to-one mapping, with an `Address` associated with an `Emp` through a foreign key.### Data Structures Used in Your Project- Java classes and objects for modeling data.- Lists and optional objects for managing and retrieving data.- Annotations from the Spring Framework for configuring and managing the application.### Project SummaryProvide a brief summary of your project, explaining its purpose and functionality. This should include an overview of the business logic and use cases it addresses. Additionally, you can mention any key features or points of interest in your application.
